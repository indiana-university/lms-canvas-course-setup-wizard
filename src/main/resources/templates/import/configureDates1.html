        As part of a course import, you can adjust the due dates associated with course events
        and assignments to fit within the start and end dates of the upcoming course. If the
        imported course and the current course are the same duration (e.g., 8 weeks, 16 weeks, etc),
        each due date will be moved to the same relative day and time in the term.
      </p>

      <h2 class="header-flow-override">About the options</h2>

        <div class="rvt-disclosure rvt-m-bottom-sm" data-rvt-disclosure="disclosure-date-options">
          <button id="learn-more-toggle" type="button" aria-controls="learn-more-content" class="rvt-disclosure__toggle" data-rvt-disclosure-toggle aria-expanded="false">Learn more about date options</button>

            <div class="rvt-prose rvt-flow">
              <h3 class="rvt-ts-18">Adjust the dates for the new term</h3>
              <p>
                When adjusting dates, you will be asked to provide the start and end dates
                for the course you are importing and the current course. Canvas will use
                this information to distribute events and assignments with due dates as
                evenly as possible across the current course and keep them due on the same
                day of the week as the original course. You'll also be given the option to
                make day substitutions to adjust for changing class schedules, such as
                moving all assignments with Monday due dates to Tuesdays.
              </p>
              <h3 class="rvt-ts-18">Remove all dates</h3>
              <p>
                The following tools will have dates removed during the import process:
              <ul class="rvt-list">
                <li>Assignments (due, availability, and peer-review dates)</li>
                <li>Announcements (delayed post dates)</li>
                <li>Quizzes (due, availability, and show correct answers dates)</li>
                <li>Calendar events (start and end dates)</li>
                <li>Modules (unlock dates)</li>
                <li>Files (availability dates)</li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <h3 class="rvt-ts-18">Leave dates as is; do not make any changes</h3>
              <p>
                Using this option, no date adjustments will happen at all after the
                import process is completed.
