            <p>
            <ul class="rvt-list">
                <li>A course home page, syllabus, and templates for assignments, quizzes, discussions, and pages will be added to your course, all formatted with your selected theme and banner.</li>
                <li>The display name for all template items will begin with the word "Template" enclosed in brackets. (e.g., [Template] Sample Assignment)</li>
                <li>The CidiLabs Multi-Tool can be found on the course settings page, just below the Course Setup Wizard button. This tool can help you bulk create modules, pages, assignments, quizzes, and discussions based on the template items.</li>
                <li>A "Wizard Next Steps" page will be added to your Canvas course with instructions on how to change out or delete the banner image, if you chose one, and how to use the Multi-Tool.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                It may take a few minutes to complete the above steps. Please be patient.
